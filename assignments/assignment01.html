Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy
text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs. 
The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the
15th century who is thought to have scrambled parts of 
Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type 
specimen book. It usually begins with:“Lorem ipsum dolor 
sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.”
The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking
block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that
doesn't distract from the layout. A practice not without 
controversy, laying out pages with meaningless filler text
can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on design,
not content. The passage experienced a surge in popularity 
during the 1960s when Letraset used it on their dry-transfer
sheets, and again during the 90s as desktop publishers 
bundled the text with their software. Today it's seen all
around the web; on templates, websites, and stock designs.
